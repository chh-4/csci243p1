X    Read the assignment.
X    Download the Supplied Files.
X    Compile, run and study the supplied program, getopt_demo.
X    Consult the discussion board periodically for new information.
X    Decompose the problem into components (functions and/or modules).
X    Write code to implement components or modules (e.g. command line processing).
X    Run tests for different system settings; to make this easier, you can create shellscripts (files containing shell commands) for different test cases.
X    Use Git to save backups and keep a version "history".
X    Assess the program results and the code for ways to improve it.
X    Repeat until the behavior and results are correct, and document divergences and difficulties in the report file.

Components:
- Initialization: Check argument errors, modes of operation. Assignment suggests Fisher-Yates shuffle
- Simulation: Calls update operation to process fire spread, check fires out.
- Update: Check neighbors, apply spread function. Assignment suggests variable-length array
- Spread: Spread the flames. Needs math. Trees burn for two cycles after initial cycle, then burn out
